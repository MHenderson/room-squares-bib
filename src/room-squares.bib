	annote = {This paper was published in 1987 and describes an approach to constructing Room squares with hill-climbing. The authors make use of the fact that a Room square is equivalent to a pair of orthogonal one-factorizations of \$K\_n\$. Two one-factorizations of the same graph are said to be orthogonal if any two factors, one from each factorization, only share at most one edge in common.
 
The second section of the paper describes how to use hill-climbing to find one-factorizations of \$K\_n\$. In the third section this approach is modified to find a one-factorization of \$K\_n\$ which is orthogonal to a given one-factorization of \$K\_n\$.
 
The basic idea behind hill-climbing is that you look for a solution by first finding a feasible solution and then making a small change to the feasible solution that decreases a cost function. The cost function measures how far you are from the solution, so as you continue making small steps, decreasing (or, at least, not increasing) the cost function you get closer and closer to the solution.
 
In the fourth section they look at a more complicated problem, of constructing Room squares with subsquares. A subsquare here just means the intersection of some rows and columns of the Room square that also happens to be a Room square.
 
Finally, in the fifth and final section they talk about some applications. One possible application is constructing large numbers of nonisomorphic one-factorizations and Room squares. Another is to use the same approach to look for previously unknown designs, like the Room squares with subsquares.},

Mullin and Nemeth, also Chong and Chan, gave a construction of skew starters for every odd prime power n. Skew balanced starters and symmetric skew balanced starters are two special types of skew starters crucially used in the construction of completely balanced Howell rotations for bridge tournaments (which is different from Howell designs and whose construction remains an open problem). Represent an odd prime power n as ek + 1 where e = 2m and k is odd. Recently, Du and Hwang gave a construction for symmetric skew balanced starters for general m ⩾ 2 but could prove its validity only for k ⩾ O(e3). Yu and Hwang improved this result to k ⩾ O(e) and conjectured that the construction is valid for all m ⩾ 2 and k − 1. In this paper we prove the conjecture except for the two cases k = 3, 9},

The main components of the proof are the starter-adder approach, two results about the existence of starters and adders for prime power and Fermat prime order, and two multiplicative constructions. With this results established the proof itself is only one paragraph. The authors points out, however, that other such proofs have actually failed to properly establish the main result. Quite likely I made this mistake in my own version of the proof in my report.
 
There is a section at the end of related problems. One is the existence of skew Room squares. I honestly don’t know if this was eventually settled or not. Another related problem is the existence of MOLS. The authors point out that a standardized Room square is equivalent to a pair of MOLS. They mention the problem of finding as large a set of MOLS as possible and refer to some results of Gross.
 
They end by reminding us that Room squares were first introduced by Howell in 1897 as Howell rotations.},

It follows immediately from the definition of an H(s,2n+2) that n+1≤s≤2n+1. A d-dimensional Howell design Hd(s,2n+2) is a d-dimensional array of side s such that (1) every cell is either empty or contains an unordered pair of elements from some 2n+2 set V, and (2) each two-dimensional projection is an H(s,2n+2). The two boundary cases are well known designs: an Hd(2n+1,2n+2) is a Room d-cube of side 2n+1 and the existence of d mutually orthogonal latin squares of order n+1 implies the existence of an Hd(n+1,2n+2). In this paper, we investigate the existence of Howell cubes, H3(s,2n+2). We completely determine the spectrum for H3(2n,2n+α) where α∈\{2,4,6,8\}. In addition, we establish the existence of 3-dimensional Room frames of type 2v for all v≥5 with only a few small possible exceptions for v.},
